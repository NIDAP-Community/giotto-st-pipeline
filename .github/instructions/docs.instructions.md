When editing docs in this repository:
- Never rewrite history in `docs/session_notes.md` or `docs/decision_log.md` (append-only).
- Prefer concrete commands and expected outputs over prose.
- Keep decisions explicit: date, decision, alternatives considered, rationale, consequences.
- If proposing a major change, first reference the relevant prior decision entry (or state that none exists yet).
